# Real-Time Database Synchronization Technologies Document

## Overview
This document details the technologies chosen for a real-time web application that maintains a full cache of a PostgreSQL database in the frontend using IndexedDB. The goal is to enable instant data loading and queries on the client side while keeping the frontend in sync with the backend database through efficient delta updates. The application uses WebSocket-like communication for real-time notifications, with writes handled via RESTful POST requests. The selected technologies are optimized for speed, reliability, and sufficiency to meet real-time requirements.

## Requirements
- **Full Frontend Cache**: Store a complete copy of the PostgreSQL database (or relevant subsets) in the browser for instant data access and queries.
- **Real-Time Synchronization**: Detect and propagate database changes to the frontend with minimal latency.
- **Efficiency**: Use delta updates to minimize data transfer and processing.
- **Reliability**: Ensure no changes are missed, even during client disconnections, with robust offline sync.
- **Fast Queries**: Enable near-instantaneous data retrieval on the client side without server round-trips.
- **One-Way Notifications**: Use WebSocket-like channels for updates/notifications only; writes are handled via POST requests to the backend.

## Chosen Technologies

### 1. PostgreSQL with wal2json
**Description**: PostgreSQL is a robust, open-source relational database. The `wal2json` extension is an output plugin for logical replication that converts Write-Ahead Log (WAL) changes into JSON format, capturing inserts, updates, and deletes.

**Role in the Application**:
- Acts as the primary backend database storing all application data.
- Uses `wal2json` to detect changes (delta updates) and stream them as JSON to the backend for real-time synchronization.

**Why Adequate**:
- **Fast**:
  - Logical replication with `wal2json` processes WAL changes in near real-time, typically with sub-second latency.
  - Outputs only changed data (e.g., modified columns), reducing payload size for efficient delta updates.
  - Optimized for high-throughput workloads with proper indexing and configuration.
- **Reliable**:
  - WAL-based replication ensures no changes are missed, even during crashes or network issues, as changes are logged before commits.
  - Supports replication slots to track client progress, preventing data loss for offline clients.
  - PostgreSQL’s ACID compliance guarantees data consistency.
- **Sufficient**:
  - `wal2json` provides structured JSON output (e.g., `{"kind":"insert","table":"users","columnvalues":{"id":1,"name":"Alice"}}`), ideal for parsing and relaying to clients without additional transformation.
  - Supports filtering (e.g., specific tables or columns), aligning with the need for a full cache of relevant data subsets.
  - Native PostgreSQL integration eliminates external dependencies.

**Configuration**:
- Enable logical replication: `wal_level = logical`, `max_replication_slots = 10` in `postgresql.conf`.
- Install `wal2json`: `CREATE EXTENSION wal2json;`.
- Create publications: `CREATE PUBLICATION my_pub FOR TABLE users, orders;`.

### 2. Go with sockjs-go
**Description**: Go is a high-performance, concurrent programming language. The `sockjs-go` library (`github.com/igm/sockjs-go/v3`) provides a WebSocket-like server with fallback transports (e.g., long polling) for reliable client communication.

**Role in the Application**:
- Runs the backend server that consumes `wal2json` streams and broadcasts delta updates to clients via SockJS.
- Handles client connections, authentication, and initial sync requests.
- Processes RESTful POST requests for database writes.

**Why Adequate**:
- **Fast**:
  - Go’s concurrency model (goroutines) efficiently handles thousands of simultaneous SockJS connections.
  - Low-latency JSON parsing and broadcasting of `wal2json` payloads.
  - Minimal overhead for WebSocket-like communication, ensuring real-time updates reach clients quickly.
- **Reliable**:
  - SockJS fallbacks (e.g., HTTP polling) ensure connectivity in environments where WebSockets are unavailable (e.g., corporate networks).
  - Go’s robust standard library and `pgx` driver support reliable PostgreSQL interactions, including replication streams.
  - Automatic reconnect logic in `sockjs-go` maintains client connections during network interruptions.
- **Sufficient**:
  - SockJS’s WebSocket-like API is ideal for one-way notifications, aligning with the requirement to send updates only (writes via POST).
  - Supports broadcasting minimal JSON payloads (delta updates from `wal2json`), reducing bandwidth usage.
  - Integrates seamlessly with Go’s HTTP server for handling both SockJS and REST endpoints.

**Implementation Notes**:
- Use `pgx` (`github.com/jackc/pgx/v5`) to consume `wal2json` replication streams.
- Authenticate SockJS connections using tokens (e.g., JWT) to secure updates.
- Batch multiple `wal2json` changes before broadcasting to optimize network usage.

### 3. IndexedDB
**Description**: IndexedDB is a client-side, NoSQL database built into modern browsers, designed for storing large amounts of structured data as JavaScript objects. It uses object stores (similar to collections) and supports indexing for fast queries.

**Role in the Application**:
- Maintains a full cache of the PostgreSQL database (or relevant tables) in the browser.
- Applies delta updates received via SockJS to keep the cache in sync.
- Enables instant data retrieval and queries without server requests.
- Stores sync metadata (e.g., `last_sync` timestamp) for offline synchronization.

**Why Adequate**:
- **Fast**:
  - IndexedDB supports efficient key-based access and indexed queries, enabling sub-millisecond data retrieval for cached data.
  - Transactions optimize batch updates (e.g., applying multiple delta updates in one operation), critical for real-time sync.
  - Asynchronous API ensures UI responsiveness during data operations.
- **Reliable**:
  - Transactions ensure data consistency, preventing partial updates during sync.
  - Persistent storage survives browser restarts, maintaining the cache for offline use.
  - Large storage limits (up to ~50% of disk space in modern browsers) support caching entire datasets.
- **Sufficient**:
  - Object stores map naturally to PostgreSQL tables (e.g., `users` table → `users` object store), simplifying cache structure.
  - Indexes on fields (e.g., `name`, `last_modified`) enable fast client-side queries, meeting the need for instant loading.
  - Flexible schema supports dynamic data from `wal2json` without rigid table definitions.
  - Stores sync metadata to fetch missed changes when reconnecting, ensuring robust offline sync.

**Implementation Notes**:
- Create one object store per table (e.g., `users`, `orders`) with `id` as the key path.
- Add indexes for frequently queried fields (e.g., `name`).
- Store `last_sync` in a `sync_metadata` object store for offline sync.

### 4. SockJS Client (JavaScript)
**Description**: The SockJS client library (`sockjs-client`) provides a WebSocket-like API for browsers, with fallbacks to HTTP-based transports. It connects to the Go SockJS server to receive real-time updates.

**Role in the Application**:
- Establishes a connection to the Go backend to receive `wal2json` delta updates.
- Sends initial sync requests (e.g., `last_sync` timestamp) when connecting.
- Passes updates to IndexedDB for cache synchronization.
- Implements reconnect logic for network interruptions.

**Why Adequate**:
- **Fast**:
  - Low-latency communication with the SockJS server ensures real-time updates reach the client quickly.
  - Minimal overhead for parsing `wal2json` JSON payloads.
  - Fallback transports maintain performance even in non-WebSocket environments.
- **Reliable**:
  - Automatic reconnect logic handles network drops, critical for maintaining sync in unstable conditions.
  - Fallbacks (e.g., long polling) ensure connectivity in restrictive networks.
  - Event-driven API integrates seamlessly with IndexedDB’s asynchronous operations.
- **Sufficient**:
  - Supports one-way notifications, aligning with the requirement to receive updates only.
  - Handles small JSON payloads efficiently, ideal for delta updates.
  - Cross-browser compatibility ensures broad client support.

**Implementation Notes**:
- Use `sockjs-client` from a CDN or npm (`npm install sockjs-client`).
- Send authentication tokens on connection to secure the channel.
- Queue updates during IndexedDB transactions to avoid race conditions.

## Architecture Overview
```
[PostgreSQL with wal2json]
   | (Logical replication streams JSON changes)
   v
[Go Backend with sockjs-go]
   | (Broadcasts delta updates via SockJS)
   v
[Browser: SockJS Client]
   | (Receives updates)
   v
[IndexedDB: Full DB Cache]
```

1. **Change Detection**: `wal2json` streams database changes (inserts, updates, deletes) as JSON.
2. **Backend Processing**: Go server (`pgx`) consumes the stream and broadcasts changes to clients via `sockjs-go`.
3. **Client Sync**: SockJS client receives updates, applies them to IndexedDB, and stores `last_sync` timestamp.
4. **Offline Sync**: On reconnect, the client sends `last_sync` to fetch missed changes.
5. **Writes**: Client sends POST requests to the Go backend, which updates PostgreSQL, triggering `wal2json` updates.

## Why This Stack Is Fast, Reliable, and Sufficient
